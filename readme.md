# What is a Deadlock?

Deadlock is heavyweight combat robot. It’s a fast four wheel drive design whose main weapon is control: a geared lifter & clamping jaws arrangement which is capable of lifting an opponent and rotating them 360 degrees around the main body. The whole robot can do backward rolls. Yes, that is awesome.

Deadlock’s armour is formed from laser cut Hardox sheet, bent and shaped to cover the drive pods and main weapon.

Traction and speed is achieved with full four wheel drive, tank style steering, with power distributed from the 2 high torque 6kw peak brushless motors via chains. The unique body shape allows the front wheels to be close to the lifting point, giving a stable base for driving whilst lifting other robots. An advanced motor control strategy using hall effect sensors allows low speed control from the light but powerful motors.

Deadlock’s weapon is an electrically powered geared lifter/clamper. Using 2 more of the powerful, high torque, 6kw brushless motors, the lift is fast and aggressive. Opponents can not only be lifted and moved around the arena, they can be slammed overhead or into the ground, bashing them into submission. The gearing is achieved by high torque but compact multi stage planetary gearboxes. The weapon is made safe by means of a locking bar when not in the arena.

## I want a Deadlock of my own`
If you have an [onshape](http://onshape.com) account (they're free), you can look at and copy [all the CAD models we used when building Deadlock](https://cad.onshape.com/documents?filter=team&teamId=58c42a52575aee0f7acbd498&column=modifiedAt&order=desc).
If your ambitions are a little smaller, why not build a [scale model of an early iteration](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:218009) or even a [drivable one](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2181223)?
